# Poem Generator and Comparison using GPT-2 and GPT-Neo

## Overview
This project is a poetry generation and comparison tool utilizing two transformer models: GPT-2 and GPT-Neo. The code generates poems based on a user-provided prompt and evaluates the outputs using BLEU and ROUGE scores.

## Features
- Generates poems using **GPT-2** and **GPT-Neo** models.
- Compares the quality of generated poems using **BLEU** and **ROUGE** metrics.
- Provides an interactive **Streamlit** web interface.
- Deploys the Streamlit application using **Ngrok**.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed:

```
pip install transformers torch streamlit rouge-score nltk pyngrok
```

If using **Google Colab**, install the required libraries first for a faster setup.

## How It Works
1. Loads pre-trained **GPT-2** and **GPT-Neo** models and tokenizers.
2. Takes user input as a prompt for poem generation.
3. Generates two versions of the poem using both models.
4. Computes BLEU and ROUGE scores to evaluate the similarity and quality of the poems.
5. Displays results via a **Streamlit** web interface.
6. Deploys the application using **Ngrok** to make it accessible online.

## Running the Project
### Running Locally
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install dependencies using:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

### Running on Google Colab
1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab**.
2. Install the required libraries using the provided `pip install` commands.
3. Run all cells sequentially.
4. Replace the **Ngrok authentication token** with your own. Sign up at [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and retrieve your token.
   ```
   ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN
   ```
5. Start the Streamlit application.
6. A public URL will be generated by **Ngrok**, allowing access to the Streamlit app.

## Evaluation Metrics
- **BLEU Score**: Measures the similarity between the two generated poems.
- **ROUGE Score**: Evaluates text overlap to determine content similarity.

## Conclusion
- **GPT-Neo** often generates more creative and longer sequences compared to **GPT-2**.
- **GPT-2** tends to produce more structured responses.
- BLEU and ROUGE scores provide quantitative insight into the similarities between the generated texts, but manual evaluation remains crucial for artistic content.

## Notes
- **Ngrok Token Expiration**: The provided authentication token has expired. You must create an Ngrok account and use your own token.
- **Performance Considerations**: The execution time depends on hardware availability, and using **Google Colab** speeds up library installation.

## Future Improvements
- Adding more transformer models for comparison.
- Fine-tuning models for improved poetry generation.
- Enhancing the web interface with more user customization options.
